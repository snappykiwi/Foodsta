## How was it made?

Foodsta is an Angular application with a backend running on Express.js. A SQL database-as-a-service from jawsDB serves and stores posts, created and populated using the Sequelize ORM, with migrations enabled. AWS S3 takes care of storing and serving all static files needed for the project, and EC2 runs the API server that serves those files.

Domain name and SSL services are provided via the AWS Route 53 and Elastic Load Balancer services.

Auth0 was chosen to power the authentication due to its flexibility and sheer out-of-the-box functionality.
